# prun

Fan out independent task units to Agy workers while the coordinating Claude session integrates. Every unit runs Gemini 3.8 Flash High at `high` effort through the Google AI plan, unattended in a scratch directory or throwaway clone. No Claude subagent or Workflow agent runs a `prun` unit, because those bill the same Claude account the coordinating session runs on, and Codex is reserved for `/vet`. Inputs a unit needs from session tools are gathered before dispatch; a task that needs those tools throughout belongs outside `prun`. Unit count follows the dependency graph instead of a small fixed cap, code-writing workers use throwaway clones, and the session plus the user remain the final integration gate.
