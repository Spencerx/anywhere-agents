"""Codex skill links: a derived view of ``.claude/skills/`` under ``.agents/skills/``.

Codex discovers repository skills only in ``.agents/skills/``, which the
composer never writes. After each committed compose, :func:`sync_links`
links ``.agents/skills/<name>`` to ``../../.claude/skills/<name>`` for every
skill whose effective hosts include ``codex``, but only where that is
provably safe. :func:`prune_links` is the uninstall counterpart: it removes
recorded links whose target directory is gone.

The links sit outside pack-lock. Their ownership record is the nested,
self-ignoring ``.agents/skills/.gitignore``: a name is ours only when that
file listed it at the start of a run, or when the run created the link.
Every other entry (tracked, case-variant, occupied, or an unlisted link) is
left alone and reported. Nothing here resolves a link before deciding what
it is, and removal is always ``os.unlink`` on the link itself, so a link can
never lead a write or delete into ``.claude/skills``.

Links are created only on macOS and Linux in this release. Elsewhere the
compose summary says so whenever Codex-eligible skills exist.
