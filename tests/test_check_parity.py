"""The shared AGENTS.md is one file in two repos; this checks the mirror.

Since the 2026-09 rewrite the shared baseline is authored in agent-config and
mirrored byte for byte into anywhere-agents (scripts/check-parity.sh lists it
under STRICT). The old section-level test here compared one banner bullet
across the two copies because the whole file was allowed to differ; full-file
identity now replaces it.

The cross-repo assertion runs only when the ac sibling clone is on the
maintainer's filesystem; CI has one repo on disk and skips it. The
single-repo checks (no maintainer-only lines in the shared file, the
generated files derived from it, the wheel mirror in step with the source)
always run.
